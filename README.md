# My project is a website of a PC showcase called Joel's PC Showcase. The website contains four HTML pages:
- home.html: The main page of the website
- pcs.html: Showcases 4 great PC's in the market
- about.html: Gives a brief info about Joel's PC showcase
- contact.html: Shows contact form and contact information (note that contact info is not real)

*Also to be noted that the 'Send' button in the 'Contact Us' page is only for show and does not send any message*

*** Note that not all buttons are working and not all contact info are real(except the social buttons) ***
